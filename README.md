# Python_With_SQLite

I have tried to complete some python exercises and concept for my understanding. 

However, to better understand some Python OOP concepts, follow the tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs
and to better understand the Python SQLITE, follow the tutorials on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byHcYRpMgI4 as well on ws3cube python playlist on Python Sqlite.

I hope this repository helps everyone.
